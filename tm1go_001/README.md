# TM1go: Go Library for IBM Planning Analytics TM1

TM1go is a Go library designed to interface with IBM Planning Analytics TM1, inspired by and closely mirroring the structure and functionality of the widely recognized tm1py Python library. This library serves as a bridge for Go developers, allowing them to interact with TM1 instances with the familiar paradigms and function names found in tm1py.

At its core, TM1go aims to provide a comprehensive, intuitive, and type-safe way to automate and manipulate TM1 objects and data directly from Go applications. By translating the flexible and powerful features of tm1py into Go, TM1go opens up a new realm of possibilities for TM1 automation, reporting, and integration tasks.

## Key Features

- Familiar Structure: Mimics the tm1py libraryâ€™s structure, making it easy for users of tm1py to transition to using Go for their TM1-related operations.
- Comprehensive Functionality: Covers a wide range of TM1 REST API features, including cube data manipulation, process execution, and server configuration, among others.
- Type-Safe Interactions: Leverages Go's type system to ensure safer and more predictable interactions with the TM1 REST API.
- Ease of Use: Simplifies the complexity of interacting with TM1's REST API, providing a straightforward and productive developer experience.
- Whether you're building custom applications, automating TM1 processes, or integrating TM1 with other services, TM1go offers a robust and developer-friendly pathway to achieving your objectives. Join us in extending the capabilities of TM1 within the Go ecosystem.
